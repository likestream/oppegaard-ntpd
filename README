# ntpd

Manages OpenNTPD - service and configuration.

## Configuration

Class ntpd takes one argument, settings, which is an array whose elements are the
literal lines that will go into `ntpd.conf(5)`.  A minimal configuration which uses
ntp.org's European pool is as follows:

    class { 'ntpd':
      settings => [
        "servers europe.pool.ntp.org",
      ],
    }

## Examples

Setting up a server which requires ntpd to be started with the `-s` parameter.

    class ntpd_server inherits ntpd::service::openbsd {
      class { 'ntpd':
        settings => [
          "listen on $::ipaddress",
          "servers europe.pool.ntp.org",
        ],
      }
      
      Rcconf['ntpd_flags'] {
        value => '"-s"',
      }
    }
    
    node 'ntp.my.domain' {
      include ntpd_server
    }

See `ntpd.conf(5)` for how to configure OpenNTPD.
